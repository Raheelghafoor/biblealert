    <h1>General Terms of Use</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="date">Last updated on 1st of August 2023</p>
        <p>Welcome to RideOn!</p>
        <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of RideOn mobile applications, websites, products, content, facilities, and platform (collectively, the “Platform”).</p>
        <p>You form a contract with us (“RideOn”, “we”, “us” or “our”) when you confirm that you accept these Terms or when you otherwise use the Platform.</p>
        <p>Supplemental terms may apply to a particular category of RideOn, such as RideOn.Courier, RideOn.Intercity, RideOn.Freight. Our privacy practices are described in Privacy Policy.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Independence for Drivers. Choices for Passengers</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Our business model</p>
        <p>Our Platform links independent third-party providers of transportation, logistics, or courier services (“Drivers”) and their clients (“Passengers”) with each other. When Passengers request a ride they offer their price for the Driver’s services. The Drivers who see the request can either agree to the offered price or make a counteroffer.</p>
        <p>The Passenger is free to choose the Driver from the list of Drivers who indicated their interest in accepting the request. A separate agreement is formed between the Driver and the Passenger, when the Passenger confirms the ride.</p>
        <p>The Passenger must pay the Driver the price that both of them agreed on via the Platform. This agreed price includes all charges associated with the ride (fees, tolls, levies, taxes, etc.). RideOn doesn’t participate and doesn’t in any way affect the settlement between the Driver and the Passenger.</p>
        <p>RideOn status</p>
        <p>RideOn is a technology company that does not provide transportation, logistics, courier, or any related services (“Services”). These Services are provided by independent Drivers with the use of our Platform. Any decision to offer or accept the Services is an independent decision made in each user’s sole discretion at the user’s own risk. RideOn does not direct or control Drivers generally or in their provision of the Services.</p>
        <p>Any feature, process, or other effort that we undertake to enhance your enjoyment of our Platform is not an indication of any employment or agency relationship with any user.</p>
        <p>These Terms do not supersede or otherwise impact the enforceability of any agreements Passengers may have with Drivers regarding the Services.</p>
        <p>Fees and Payments</p>
        <p>RideOn may charge Drivers a license fee for using the Platform. We may change the license fee amount from time to time. Your continued use of the Platform will constitute your acceptance of the updated fees.</p>
        <p>The license fee charged for each completed order. Payments are recorded in your personal account, and you can find the current amount of the license fee in your personal account.</p>

        <p>We urge you to exercise caution and care when interacting with other users. You use and provide Driver’s Services at your own risk...</p>

        <p>In case of any suspected threat to health or safety, immediately report it to user support (<a href="https://RideOn.com/en/contacts/support/">https://RideOn.com/en/contacts/support/</a>) or use the “SOS button”...</p>

        <p>The SOS button has two options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>give you an opportunity to call the police in your country. If you click the "Call the police" button, a standard dial bar with an auto-fitted police number will open.</li>
            <li>give you an opportunity to share your ride information with a number from your contacts. If you click on the "Send ride information" button, the selection panel of the recipient of the ride information opens and then the information about your ride is sent to the number specified by you.</li>
