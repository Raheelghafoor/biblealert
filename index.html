    <h1>General Terms of Use</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="date">Last updated on 1st of August 2023</p>
        <p>Welcome to Tap Trade!</p>
        <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of Tap Trade’s mobile applications, websites, products, content, facilities, and platform (collectively, the “Platform”).</p>
        <p>You form a contract with us (“Tap Trade,” “we,” “us” or “our”) when you confirm that you accept these Terms or when you otherwise use the Platform.</p>
        <p>Supplemental terms may apply to specific features of Tap Trade, such as Tap Trade. Crypto, Tap Trade. Stocks, and Tap Trade. Forex. Our privacy practices are described in our Privacy Policy.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Independence for Traders. Choices for Users</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Our business model</p>
        <p>Our Platform links independent traders (“Traders”) and their clients (“Users”) for buying, selling, and exchanging various financial assets (stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex, etc.). When Users make a trade request, they propose their price for the asset. Traders can either accept the proposed price or make a counteroffer.</p>
        <p>Users are free to choose their Trader from the list of interested traders. A separate agreement is formed when the User confirms the trade request with the Trader.</p>
        <p>Payments for the trade are processed via the Platform. The price agreed upon includes all fees, taxes, or other charges associated with the transaction. Tap Trade does not participate in or influence the settlement of trades between Traders and Users.</p>
        <p>Tap Trade status</p>
        <p>Tap Trade is a technology company that does not engage in trading activities or hold assets. All trading activities are conducted by independent Traders using our Platform. Users make independent decisions when selecting Traders and engaging in trades at their own risk. Tap Trade does not control or direct Traders in their trading activities.</p>
        <p>These Terms do not supersede or affect any separate agreements Users may have with Traders regarding the trade.</p>
